# Supervised Time Series Classification with Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

## Project Description

In this project, we explore and implement various neural network architectures for supervised time series classification tasks. The goal is to compare the performance of different architectures, including those based on convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based approaches. 
## Data Sources
The datasets utilized in this project are sourced from the Time Series Classification platform and can be retrieved using the tslearn library.

## A collaborative project: Fatima Ezzahrae & Nicolas. 
## Supervision: Mr. Romain Tavenrad.
